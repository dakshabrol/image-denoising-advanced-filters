# 🖼️ Image Denoising Using Advanced Filtering Techniques

Welcome to the **Image Denoising** project! This repository explores various advanced filtering techniques designed to remove noise from images while preserving essential features like edges and textures. We investigate both time-domain and frequency-domain filters, evaluating their performance across different noise types and levels.

## 🛠️ Filters Implemented

Here’s a rundown of the advanced filters included in this project:

1. **🪄 Decision-Based Coupled Window Median Filter**  
   A dynamic time-domain filter that adjusts its window size based on the noise level, effectively removing impulse noise while preserving image details.

2. **🔄 Switching-Based Median Filter**  
   This filter alternates between two median filters with different window sizes, excelling at removing high-density salt and pepper noise.

3. **📏 Noise Density Range Sensitive Mean Median Filter**  
   By calculating mean and median values within a window, this filter uses noise density to set thresholds, effectively tackling impulse noise while maintaining image integrity.

4. **🔍 Adaptive Median Filter**  
   Adapting its window size based on pixel value ranges, this filter is effective against various noise types, including salt and pepper as well as Gaussian noise.

5. **🌐 Dual Domain Image Denoising Filter**  
   Operating in both spatial and frequency domains, this filter employs a Gaussian filter in the frequency domain and a bilateral filter in the spatial domain, making it effective for Gaussian noise removal.
